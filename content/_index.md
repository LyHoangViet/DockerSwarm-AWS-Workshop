# Integrating Docker Swarm with AWS Services

#### Overview
In this workshop, I will present the process of deploying and working with **Docker**, a powerful tool for managing and operating containers. To effectively orchestrate and manage containers, I used **Docker Swarm** – a built-in solution provided by Docker. Additionally, I leveraged several services on **AWS** to optimize the deployment and management of the system on the cloud platform, which helps enhance the flexibility and scalability of the application.
